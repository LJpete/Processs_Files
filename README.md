<h1>Nivo File Processor</h1>

<h5>This tool is designed with with the automated integration of my assays analysis software and data generated by a Revvity victor nivo in mind. Particularilty for situations where the analyser must process samples from a batch in more than one reading. eg batch =90, and the chip inserted into the reader accomodates for 30 samples</h5>
<h5>For semi-automated laboratories, it streamlines the dataprocessing workflow, combining files, triggering analysis and outputing data all at the touch of a finger (or three). It allows for simultanious processing of data within the same shared nextwork drive (tracking files by plate barcode); and is setup to act as a wrapper for future calculations are to be run by an indipendent, locally maintained tool.</h5>
<h5>SampleID is recieved from the liquid handler or can be generated by the user</h5>
<h2>Setup and integrating the software</h2>
<h5>In my implimentation, analysis chips (udrop nano) require their own well based correction factor. These values have been integrated into the my assay protocol and ajust for microvariations within the quarts across the reusable plate. The function of each ui element can be seen below:</h5>
<h5>'uDrop chip', distincnt methods (in my case [A|B] can be run with the suitable corrrection factor.,</h5>
<h5>'hBarcode' refers to the batch of sampeles</h5>
<h5>'n chips read', this one should be pretty sstraight cut, increase at your leasure</h5>
<h5>'check output files', this  </h5>
<h5>'run my assays', this is the crux, run your analsis through the software (my assays, plate by plate)</h5>
<h5>'combine output files', your analysis has been completed get everything ready for reeview and upload through a trusty vbs script in excel</h5>
<H2>file dependencies</H2>
<h5>This project has two main files for the user to control. At this stage they are stored within the working directory of the program (for simplicity's sake). Perhaps a settings menu would be nice but at the end of the day, Im assuming if you are compiling my code, you can modify the parameters files</h5>
<h5>the first file: 'arguments.template' variables selected by the user are inserted into this template for run specific details. Please see 'MyAssays user desktop guide' for more information on how to structure this call to program. </h5>
<h5>The other file that might need modification is: 'system.locations'. This is how the end user defines where the program looks for data.follwoing the format: ([name of location],\n, [absolute path of location],\n) ..... 5 times</h5>
<h2>Changes to be made</h2>
<h5>Cleanup some of the junk dll files created when compiling/random language packs is a big one. Also if it becomes an issue where the wrong plate is being is being selected[a where b should be....ect], it wouldnt be hard to create barcodes, have the liquid handler scan the barcodes and create and output list. this would remove a place where the user would have to make a decision.</h5>
